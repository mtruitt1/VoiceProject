# Data set folder(s)
 Due to potential copyright issues, the raw data set from which the spectrogram images are created is not included in this repository. The folders are included to show which voice sets were extracted from and imported into this project.
 
 The games from which audio were extracted are as follows:
 Fallout 3(FO3)
 Fallout: New Vegas(FONV)
 Fallout 4
 Fallout 76
 
 Only voice sets with clearly defined age were used. Any unspecified age among these sets is assumed to be an adult voice.
